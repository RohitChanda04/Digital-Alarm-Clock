# Digital-Alarm-Clock

An implementation of a user-friendly digital alarm clock which allows the user to preview the different available alarm tones and select one from them. This application is purely built on Java on the grounds of Maven, and styled on CSS. For building the UI, I have used JavaFX and implemented the CSS styling into it.

> Technologies used:
>    Java, Maven, JavaFX and CSS

Users can either fire up the Digital Alarm Clock with the current system time which is fetched using the LocalDateTme package or they could also use it as a stop watch starting from a time entered thrugh the parameterized constructor. The alarm tones are placed inside the ***resources*** folder and would be fetched automatically when the user runs the application. Since the application is built on JavaFX, the actions are caught on click through built-in methods of the appripriate JavaFX liraries.

## How to run

For simplicity, I have uploaded the entire project along with the required files so that the users can directly import/download/clone the project on to their systems to run it locally. Once downloaded, import the project on to the IDE of your choice and ensure that you have Maven installed. The ***pom.xml*** should already contain all the necessary dependencies needed for the application to run successfully.
